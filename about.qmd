Hi all! my name is Derek and I am currently a Y2 SMU student majoring in Economics and Data Science Analytics! I initially took this module to expose myself to geographical and spatial data. No doubt, this is one of the toughest module I have ever taken, but I have taken away so much from this module. I am not afraid to admit that I am still not the best in this area, but I have always believed in exploring new areas and live long learning, and I can safely say that I have no regrets taking this Module.
