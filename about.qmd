Hi all! my name is Derek and I am currently a Y2 SMU student majoring in Economics and Data Science Analytics! I initially took this module to expose myself to geographical and spatial data. No doubt, this is one of the toughest module I have ever taken, and am not afraid to admit that I am still not the best in this aspect of data, but I have always believed in exploring new areas and life long learning!
